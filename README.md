# CSCI-331-4-g4_robusy--sudoku-solver
Semester long group project in intro to AI which we can and should get done before the first half is done.

# Problem Description : 
Implement a solver for a Customized Sudoku Puzzle using constraint satisfaction techniques. The base rules of Sudoku apply that each row, column, and region must contain all digits without repetition. Implement and use two algorithms: (1) plain backtracking search and (2) backtracking enhanced with CSP methods such as forward checking or arc consistency

Also, report the difference in efficiency between the two algorithms and explain why the CSP-enhanced version performs better.
